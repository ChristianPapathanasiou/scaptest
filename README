- Report to Nagios
#*******************************************************************************#
# Operating Systems and Dependencies
#*******************************************************************************#
                     Centos 6, Centos 7, RHEL 6 and RHEL 7
#*******************************************************************************#
- Installations:
   * Note: Install Perl Modules with "perl -MCPAN -e 'install MODULE'"
   * XML::Twig           - yum install perl-XML-Twig
   * XML::LibXML         - yum install perl-XML-LibXML
   * Config::General     - yum install perl-Config-General
   * OpenSCAP            - yum install openscap-scanner
   * Security Guide      - yum install scap-security-guide
   * Bzip2               - yum install bzip2
   * Wget                - yum install wget

Centos 6: 
- Compliance Test: It can use RHEL 6 file. It works right out of the box.
- Vulnerabilities Test: Uses createCentosCVE(), function developed by Graham Mosley.
It modifies RHEL feed in order to work with centos.

Centos 7:
- Compliance Test: Uses RHEL 7 baseline file from openscap folder. It works right out
of the box. 
- Vulnerabilities Test: Uses createCentosCVE(), function developed by Graham Mosley.
It modifies RHEL feed in order to work with centos. 

NOTE: Graham Mosley code changes the corresponding CentOS version, changes the
platform information, and sign keys to the CentOS equivalent on RHEL.

RHEL 6:
- Compliance Test: It uses RHEL feed from openscap. It works right out of the box
- Vulnerabilities Test: Uses general rhel feed retreived from the internet.

RHEL 7:
- Compliance Test: Uses openscap RHEL 7 feed. It works right out of the box.
- Vulnerabilities Test: Uses general rhel feed retreived from the internet.

#*******************************************************************************#
- Installations:
   * Note: Install Perl Modules with "perl -MCPAN -e 'install MODULE'"
   * XML::Twig           - zypper install perl-XML-Twig

SLES 12:
- Compliance Test: Uses CIS-CAT benchmark; no baseline file from openscap found yet.

NOTE: Both sles machines retreive their severities from the cvss database.
#*******************************************************************************#
                             Ubuntu 14 and Ubuntu 16
#*******************************************************************************#
- Installations:
   * Note: Install Perl Modules with "perl -MCPAN -e 'install MODULE'"
   * XML::Twig           - apt-get install xml-twig-tools libxml-twig-perl
   * XML::LibXML         - apt-get install libxml-libxml-perl
   * Config::General     - apt-get install libconfig-general-perl
   * OpenSCAP            - apt-get install libopenscap8
   * Bzip2               - apt-get install bzip2
   * Wget                - apt-get install wget

Ubuntu 14:
- Compliance Test: Uses CIS-CAT benchmark; no baseline file from openscap found yet.
- Vulnerabilities Test: There is an existing file for ubuntu 14 feed. The problem
is that SCAP and openscap versions are not being compatible at the time of running
the audit.

Ubuntu 16:
- Compliance Test: Does not have a CIS-CAT benchmark yet, nor openscap.
- Vulnerabilities Test: There is an existing file for ubuntu 16. It is running right
out of the box.
#*******************************************************************************#
                                   Debian 8
#*******************************************************************************#
- Installations:
   * Note: Install Perl Modules with "perl -MCPAN -e 'install MODULE'"
   * Config::General     - apt-get install libconfig-general-perl
   * XML::Twig           - apt-get install libxml-twig-perl
   * XML::LibXML         - apt-get install libxml-libxml-perl
   * OpenSCAP            - apt-get install libopenscap8
   * Bzip2               - apt-get install bzip2
   * Wget                - apt-get install wget

Debian 8:
- Compliance Test: Uses CIS-CAT benchmark; no baseline file from openscap found yet.
- Vulnerabilities Test: Debian was not supported since 2011; last new files were
released las July 25, 2016. So further tests need to be done in order to see if
files are accurate. Severities are still not found.
#*******************************************************************************#
                             FreeBSD, Solaris, Windows
#*******************************************************************************#
- Compliance Test: Windows and Solaris have CIS-CAT benchmarks; no openscap file 
found yet. However, FreeBSD has a CIS-CAT benchmark, but does not come with this
ciscat package, so it has to be searched.
- Vulnerabilities Test: FreeBSD and Solaris have oval files, and store severities
in the same file. However, FreeBSD file format is very different so it might not
work out of the box. Files for Windows need to be searched.

# Executing
#*******************************************************************************#
When executing the program for the first time you can run CopyFiles script to place
in the specific folders the needed files to run the system. To check if it is working
you can run the cron job file. It is configured to run daily.

In order to run CIS-CAT you need to download it from their web page and extract it at
the /usr/local/lib/scaptest directory. It needs openJDK installed in order to run.
The current script is assuming that the jdk package is extracted in the working directory.
In order to exclude adding the jdk folder, change in the runCISCAT function the run command
for "./CIS-CAT.sh" and then the commands that follow the line.

To download the CIS-CAT bundle you need a licence, however, it can be downloaded from 
https://community.cisecurity.org/collab/public/.
The Oracle JDK package can be downloaded from http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/
downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnes.

In order to report to nagios you have to manually add both Check functions to the
10_General file.
